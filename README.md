TokenMatcher (WIP)
==================

TokenMatcher is intended to be a simple wrapper around PhpParser. The hope is to simplify the use
of that wonderful library.

In working on Parser, we have made complaints on several occasions on how difficult it can be to
use PhpParser, at least in our particular case. So I took it upon myself to wrap PhpParser
with something that is hopefully a bit easier to use.

This is currently a work in progress.
